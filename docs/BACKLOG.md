# Backlog

What's missing to go from "the hub can chat" to a usable family app. This is
a scannable list, not a narrative - full reasoning and decision history for
any item lives in `docs/dev.md` (linked where useful) or the relevant
platform standard in `getmaipai/.github`. Update this file whenever a gap
closes or a new one is found; don't let it drift from what `main` actually
does.

Rough size tags: **S** (a session or less), **M** (a real slice, days),
**L** (a platform-level capability, needs its own design pass first).

## Naming: rename `skill` to `plugin`, add real `skill` and `command`

Decided 2026-09-05 (full research and reasoning in `docs/dev.md`'s
"Naming: skill, plugin, command, connector" entry). The rename itself is
done; the other two items are still real, tracked work.

- [x] **Rename the `skill` manifest kind to `plugin`** (M-L, done
      2026-09-05, `docs/dev.md`'s "The skill -> plugin rename, executed"
      entry) - no behavior change to `weather`/`joke`/`trivia`/`define`/
      `remember`/`recall`, just the correct name for what they already
      are. Included a real data migration for `conversation_turns` rows
      with genuine data from tonight's live testing, not just a schema
      change. Still open: `getmaipai/.github/docs/PACKAGES.md` (org-wide,
      affects `bot` and `catalog` too) and the planned `catalog` repo
      layout haven't been updated to match yet - a separate repo's commit,
      tracked here so it isn't forgotten.
- [x] **Add a real `skill` kind: plain instructions, Claude-`SKILL.md`-
      compatible, no independent permissions** (M, done 2026-09-05,
      `docs/dev.md`'s "The real skill kind, shipped" entry) - composed
      into the chat model's system prompt when relevant (reusing the
      plugin floor's own `exampleScore` relevance matching, never
      executed on its own), safely user-authorable since it can't touch
      the network or any permission surface. Ships with a real bundled
      example (`storytime-style`) proving genuine Claude-format
      compatibility - real YAML frontmatter, stripped before composition,
      tested. Live-testing it found a real, honest cross-package routing
      collision (a bedtime-story request hijacked by the `joke` plugin's
      own keyword-overlap placeholder) - concrete evidence for the
      already-tracked `embed` role below, not something patched here.
- [x] **Formalize `command` as a first-class, user-creatable primitive**
      (M, done 2026-09-05, `docs/dev.md`'s "The `command` primitive,
      shipped" entry) - reuses `matchPattern` (`turnEngine.ts`) exactly
      as-is, checked before the plugin floor since a household's own
      trigger always wins. Two action shapes (`reply`,
      `home_call_service`, the latter reusing plugin's own
      `home.call_service` plumbing via a new shared `packageHost.ts`
      export). Security-domain commands (lock/alarm/cover/garage/valve)
      require an owner/admin creator and a `min_role` floor of `adult`,
      checked once at creation rather than re-derived per trigger. HTTP
      surface only so far - no authoring UI yet, tracked below.
- [x] **No new "connector" concept needed** - `integration` (an
      existing manifest kind) already is one. Nothing to build here;
      recorded so the question doesn't get re-asked.
- [ ] **A settings UI for authoring commands** (S-M) - `lib/commands.ts`
      and its `/api/commands` routes are done and tested; there's no
      household-facing "when I say X, do Y" builder yet, only the raw
      HTTP surface.

## Skill standards (definition of done)

Jesse's call (2026-09-05): this should rank alongside, not after, building
more skills - a standard nobody's held to gets more expensive to retrofit
the more packages exist, not cheaper. `getmaipai/.github/docs/PACKAGES.md`
already defines a real bar for every package (skills included); checked
against what the 6 bundled skills actually have today, none of them
clear it in full:

- [ ] **A real `quality_scale.yaml` per package** (S per package) - today
      `quality_scale` is one string field inside `manifest.json`, not the
      separate file with bronze/silver/gold criteria the standard
      describes (tests green, five-plus routing examples, a privacy row
      per data source, stated offline behavior, a smoke test, README and
      changelog present, lint clean). The routing-examples and privacy-row
      and offline-behavior parts are genuinely met already; the smoke test
      and the file itself are not.
- [ ] **A `smoke` entry per package** (S-M per package, M to design the
      mechanism once) - "runs where the package will live, at install, at
      every update, and on a schedule; a failure leaves it installed but
      disabled with a Repairs item." No smoke-test mechanism or Repairs
      concept exists anywhere in this codebase yet - this is real
      infrastructure, not just a per-package checkbox.
- [ ] **A user-tier `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` per package** (S per
      package) - the "store card" a household or the catalog's browse UI
      would show; none of the 6 bundled packages has either today.
- [ ] **Real i18n for skills** (L) - genuinely undecided, not just
      unbuilt: no `getmaipai/.github` standard mentions i18n at all today,
      so this needs a design decision before any code. At minimum:
      `manifest.json`'s `display`/`description` and a recipe's `format`
      step text are hardcoded English strings today, and `routing.
      examples`/`routing.patterns` (the deterministic floor's whole
      matching mechanism) would need real per-locale variants for
      anything beyond English to route at all - not a small addition
      once the `embed` role and Tier 2 both eventually depend on
      matching against those same examples.

Default packages are held to the same bar as community ones per
`PACKAGES.md` - the release skill is meant to refuse shipping a default
set with anything below bronze, which today it structurally can't check
(there's no `quality_scale.yaml`/smoke mechanism for it to look at).

## Skills (Tier 0 catalog)

Bundled today: `remember`, `recall`, `weather`, `define`, `joke`, `trivia`.
Everything else a family would reach for is missing, prioritized on one
rule Jesse set (2026-09-05): **a lookup (read a fact, return it) beats a
control/playback action (make something happen in the world) whenever
they'd otherwise tie.** A lookup is cheaper to build (no external device
or playback surface to actually drive, no failure mode beyond "the fetch
failed"), safer (no consequential-gate/permission story to design), and
still real, standalone value on its own - "what song is this" is useful
even before "now play it" exists. A control skill also usually *depends*
on the lookup half existing first anyway (you search for the song before
you can play it), so building lookups first is both lower-risk and
frequently a hard prerequisite, not just a preference.

**Priority 1 - lookups (read-only, no external device/playback surface):**

- [ ] Web search (S-M) - already decided as "permitted and required"
      (`docs/dev.md`'s 2026-09-04 tier 2 note); the highest-value single
      lookup missing, and the one most likely to replace a real fall-
      through-to-model miss today.
- [ ] Music / media search (S-M) - "what's this song," "who sings X,"
      show/movie info and availability. A pure lookup against a
      catalog/metadata API - explicitly NOT the same skill as playing
      anything (see Priority 3 below); this is the half of "media" that's
      cheap, safe, and useful standalone.
- [ ] Unit and currency conversion (S) - pure `host.fetch` shape, same
      pattern as `weather`/`define` (e.g. frankfurter.app for currency).
- [ ] Math / quick calculation (S)
- [ ] News headlines (S-M) - most free headline APIs need a key; find one
      that doesn't, or accept the config step.
- [ ] Sports scores (S-M)
- [ ] Translation (S-M)

**Priority 2 - simple local actions (writes to our own data, no external
device or service to control):**

- [ ] Reminders / timers (S-M) - `host.schedule` already exists; this is
      mostly a recipe + manifest away.
- [ ] Shopping / todo lists (M) - needs a new record type (a list, with
      items), so a small spec addition, not just a recipe.

**Priority 3 - control / playback (drives a real external device or
service; lower priority by the rule above, and often blocked on its own
Priority-1 lookup landing first):**

- [ ] Media playback control (L) - built extensively in the legacy
      pre-rebuild code (YouTube integration, cookie-jar auth, session
      keeper), none of it migrated to this platform yet. Largest single
      skill area by legacy scope, and the one this session's own priority
      rule pushes behind music/media search.
- [ ] At least one skill that actually calls `home.call_service` (S) - the
      permission/security model shipped 2026-09-05; nothing uses it yet.
      Lower priority than the lookups above by the same rule (it drives a
      real device), though it's already unblocked (no missing
      integration to build first, unlike media playback).

## Integrations

- [ ] **Calendar** (L) - doesn't exist. Needs a design decision first:
      local-only entry within MaiPai vs. a real CalDAV/OAuth connection to
      an existing family calendar (Google/Apple/Nextcloud). See the
      compose-step sketch in `docs/dev.md`'s "Notes for later" for how this
      feeds a real multi-source answer. Reading a calendar is itself a
      lookup (Priority 1 by the Skills rule above) - it's the auth/sync
      plumbing underneath that makes this L-sized, not the read.
- [ ] **Email search** (L) - doesn't exist. No permission-vocab slot fits
      inbox access yet; needs its own consent design (see `docs/dev.md`'s
      2026-09-05 note on this) before any client code. Same shape as
      calendar: the search itself is a lookup, the sensitivity and auth
      plumbing are what make it L.
- [ ] **Media/streaming integrations** (L) - see Skills above; split the
      same way: metadata/search auth (feeds the Priority-1 music/media
      search skill, and is the smaller, safer half to build first) versus
      real playback/streaming auth (feeds the Priority-3 playback-control
      skill - rate limiting, the "we are the user" pacing rules already
      written into `getmaipai/.github`, and meaningfully more integration
      surface than a metadata lookup needs).
- [ ] Verify Home Assistant against a real instance (S, blocked on
      hardware/access, not effort) - the client is built and mock-tested;
      never proven against the real thing.
- [ ] A recipe step (or Tier 1 path) that can actually reach
      `host.integration.call` (M) - the host method exists; nothing can
      invoke it today.

## Vision

- [ ] `host.camera.still` (L) - no pipeline, no hardware path in this repo
      (the hub isn't the camera; this likely means "receive a photo the
      robot or a phone took," not "the hub has a camera").
- [ ] `host.ocr.read` (M) - RapidOCR already decided as the library
      (`docs/dev.md`); needs wiring, a recipe step, and a real image input
      path (upload? robot capture?) before it's reachable at all.

## Generation (image, video)

- [ ] Image generation (L) - deliberately not started. The org's
      non-removable child-safety invariants for generation features (see
      `getmaipai/.github` > Safety invariants) mean this needs real design
      attention before any code, not a quick slice.
- [ ] Video generation (L) - same posture, same reason.

## Advanced tool calling (Tier 2)

- [ ] Real multi-source, multi-skill answers (L) - see `docs/dev.md`'s
      2026-09-04 tier 2 note and the 2026-09-05 stress-test against it.
      Explicitly NOT an open agentic loop by design; the current best
      candidate shape is a bounded `compose` recipe step (one model call,
      author-fixed tool sequence) plus richer chained recipes. Sequencing
      already decided: ship `embed` (real semantic routing) first, ship
      more real skills, measure the actual fall-through rate from real
      conversation history, then decide whether to build this at all.
- [ ] The `embed` role itself (M) - referenced everywhere as the fix for
      today's keyword-overlap routing placeholder; not built.

## Feature parity: ChatGPT / Gemini / Claude

Jesse's ask (2026-09-05): research what ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude actually
ship today and add what's missing here. Real web research, not recalled
training data (this session's own standing rule after the persona-research
correction earlier tonight). Only genuinely new-to-this-list items get their
own bullets below; anything that overlaps a section above is a cross-
reference there instead, not a duplicate.

- [ ] **Projects: a persistent, instructed workspace scoped above a single
      conversation** (L) - doesn't exist in any form. ChatGPT Projects
      (custom instructions + a shared file Library scoped to the project,
      instructions now up to 5,000 characters as of July 2026) and Claude
      Projects (instructions + files, auto-switching to retrieval search
      once a project's files near the model's context limit, extending
      effective capacity roughly 10x) are the two real references. MaiPai
      has nothing between "one chat" and "the whole household's settings"
      - no scoped, reusable instruction+file container a person could set
      up once ("help with my woodworking projects," "track my training
      plan") and return to. This is closer to a new record type + a new
      chat surface than a skill.
- [ ] **Canvas / Artifacts: a side panel for iterating on a document or
      running code, not just chat text** (L) - doesn't exist. Real
      differences worth knowing before designing this, not just "build a
      canvas": Claude Artifacts actually execute and render results live
      in the panel (React components, HTML, SVG - as of June 2026 you can
      highlight part of an artifact and describe an edit in place), while
      Gemini Canvas is edit-only - it does not execute code, you copy it
      out to run it. Code execution itself is a separate, real capability
      none of the three vendors bolt onto raw chat text: Gemini's code
      execution tool runs actual Python server-side (30-second cap, learns
      iteratively from its own output). If this gets built, "does it run
      code or just display it" is the first real design fork, not a
      detail - and running arbitrary code has a real sandboxing story to
      design (Tier 1's Deno boundary is the closest existing precedent in
      this codebase, not a ready answer).
- [ ] **Deep Research: a multi-step, multi-source research mode that
      returns a cited report** (L) - doesn't exist, and it's a different
      shape than the Tier 2 note's own rejected "autonomous loop": ChatGPT
      and Gemini call it Deep Research, Claude calls it Research; all
      three run several minutes of multi-step web search/reading and
      return one cited report, which is closer to "one long, bounded,
      author-understood job with a fixed goal" than to open-ended runtime
      tool selection - worth a design pass of its own, not lumped into the
      Tier 2 note's already-decided "no autonomous loop" verdict without
      checking whether this specific bounded shape is actually the same
      risk the note was written against.
- [ ] **A stated policy on identifying a person from a photo** (S to
      decide, since it's a decision not code) - a real, undecided gap this
      research surfaced, distinct from the vision/generation gaps already
      listed. The three vendors disagree with each other: ChatGPT refuses
      identifying anyone from an image outright ("I can't identify people
      in images for privacy reasons"); Claude's model appears to recognize
      public figures internally but its output is trained to refuse
      disclosing it; Gemini will name a public figure on request, and
      Google's separate "Personal Intelligence" feature (expanded to all
      free US users March 2026) links Gemini directly to a user's Google
      Photos face-recognition data. `getmaipai/.github`'s existing hard
      rule ("no feature is built whose purpose is generating imagery of
      identifiable real people") governs generation only - there is no
      MaiPai stance at all on recognizing/naming a person from an uploaded
      photo, which is a real, separate question `host.camera.still`/`host.
      ocr.read` will eventually force regardless of which vendor's
      posture MaiPai ends up closest to.

Three more items the research turned up that are worth a one-line note
here but are NOT new gaps - they sharpen or confirm something already
listed above, so read them as amendments, not additions:

- **Barcode/QR reading** (Jesse's own example) turns out to already have a
  decided answer in this repo's own notes: `docs/dev.md`'s vision-review
  section already picked `zxing-cpp` for barcodes specifically (real
  dedicated decoders read a 1D UPC barcode far more reliably than asking
  a vision-language model to "read" one - confirmed general capability,
  not a barcode-specific one, in this research: all three vendors can
  read a clean QR code as an image-understanding task, which is a
  different and easier problem than decoding a real, imperfectly-lit 1D
  barcode). Nothing new to add to the Vision section above; it already
  lists `host.ocr.read`/`host.camera.still` as the real blocking gaps.
- **Scheduled automation** (ChatGPT Tasks, Gemini Scheduled Actions, Claude
  Scheduled Tasks) confirms the Proactive/ambient intelligence section
  above is aimed at something real and already shipped elsewhere, not a
  speculative idea - worth citing concretely: reporting says ChatGPT's
  original Tasks was "a glorified reminder app" and Gemini's was
  restricted to Google Workspace tools, while Claude's version does real
  automation (multi-step workflows, broad connectors, cloud-persistent
  execution independent of any device being on) - a genuine target shape
  for the "caching/freshness layer" piece already broken out in that
  section, not a reason to rewrite it.
- **Full-duplex, barge-in voice conversation** (GPT-Live, Gemini Live - both
  can listen and generate at the same time instead of waiting for a pause,
  sub-500ms median latency reported for ChatGPT's) is the concrete target
  shape for the Voice/robot section's "wake word past phase 1" line above,
  not a new item - a real number to measure against once that work starts,
  where today there is no number at all.
- **Custom GPTs / Gemini Gems** turn out to already be close to something
  MaiPai has, not a gap: a GPT/Gem is a closed, vendor-specific custom
  assistant, while MaiPai's own package manifest (skill/app/companion/
  integration, with declared permissions and routing) is structurally
  closer to the open, portable "Skill" format multiple vendors and tools
  now read (a SKILL.md-shaped standard, per this research, read by over
  30 different tools as of early 2026) than to a closed GPT/Gem. The real
  gap here isn't a new concept to design - it's the `catalog` repo
  existing for real, already listed above as its own item.

## UI / shell

- [x] Person edit and delete (M) - done 2026-09-05. `PATCH`/`DELETE`
      `/api/people/:id` plus `POST /api/people/batch-delete`, the rules
      in `lib/personLifecycle.ts`, and real UI with multi-select. A
      deleted person's memories, conversations, settings, jobs and
      recordings are erased for real; the person row becomes a tombstone.
      See `docs/dev.md`, "Person edit and delete".
- [x] Backup restore, end to end (S) - done 2026-09-05. Staged, not
      applied live: the route decrypts and verifies, `db/index.ts`
      swaps it in at the next start. Owner-only, with a real
      confirmation. See `docs/dev.md`, "Restore, staged and applied at
      boot".
- [x] A privacy page ("what leaves the house") (M) - done 2026-09-05.
      `GET /api/privacy` aggregates every bundled package's
      `data_sources[]` plus the hub's own downloads (models, engine,
      wake word, TTS program, TTS model, voice files, embeddings);
      `/privacy` renders it in dad-test language. See `docs/dev.md`,
      "The privacy page".
- [ ] **Batch select and clear-all everywhere else** (M) - the org rule
      landed 2026-09-05 (`getmaipai/.github/docs/UI.md` > Batch actions,
      Jesse: "every section should provide easy batch and or delete all
      mechanism"). People has it. Memory does not, and is the case Jesse
      named specifically: it needs multi-select archive/forget plus a
      real clear-all, which also finally gives `lib/memory.ts`'s
      `forget()` a UI (`MemoryPage.tsx`'s own comment deferred it for
      want of a confirmation pattern; `PeoplePage.tsx` now has one worth
      lifting into the kit). Conversation history and notifications
      inherit the same rule when they get surfaces.
- [ ] **The kit owns the batch-selection pattern** (S) - `PeoplePage.tsx`
      hand-rolls selection mode, the count, the confirmation panel and
      the partial-success report. The second consumer (Memory, above) is
      the moment that becomes a kit primitive rather than a copy.
- [ ] Notifications UI (L, blocked on the notification system below)
- [ ] Package/skill catalog browsing and install (L) - blocked on the
      `catalog` repo existing for real; today only local bundled packages
      run at all.
- [ ] Admin / parental-controls surface beyond the generic settings
      renderer (M)
- [ ] **The rest of accessibility** (M) - the 2026-09-05 pass measured
      what can be measured mechanically (targets, names, text size,
      overflow, focus rings). Untouched: colour contrast ratios against
      the real token palette in both themes, a screen-reader read-through
      of each page, keyboard-trap testing, reduced-motion, and the TV
      surface (which has no input-mode detection yet, so there is nothing
      to test). Worth wiring the measurable half into a script the
      screenshot pipeline runs, so it cannot regress silently.
- [ ] Onboarding beyond the one-time initial household setup (M)
- [x] Accessibility audit (M) - done 2026-09-05, driven against the
      running app at phone and desktop, not read off the source: 142
      violations found, all fixed, re-measured at zero. See `docs/dev.md`,
      "The accessibility audit". Not covered and still open below: colour
      contrast, screen-reader flow, keyboard traps, and the TV surface.
- [ ] Any UI for calendar, email, camera/vision, or generation (blocked on
      each of those existing first)
- [ ] **The `app` kind: full, multi-page apps (Videos/Weather/Podcasts-
      style), decided architecture, not built** (L; full reasoning in
      `docs/dev.md`'s "Naming" entry, 2026-09-05). Decided: same process,
      same origin, no iframe, no remote hosting - an `app` package is its
      own directory (mirroring `backend/packages/<id>/`) exporting its
      own nested route subtree, mounted into the one frontend the same
      way the legacy hub nested Videos'/Podcasts' many pages under one
      layout route. Picked explicitly over an iframe/postMessage model
      (the real precedent behind ChatGPT's Apps SDK, researched and then
      rejected here) for lower complexity, no new failure mode, and no
      new trust boundary - Jesse's own stated bar, not assumed.
- [x] **Build the missing kit primitives before the first full app, not
      alongside it** (M) - done 2026-09-05. `getmaipai/.github/docs/UI.md`
      decided that apps never build their own chrome (sidebar, search,
      cards): they declare typed blueprint contributions and compose
      pages from shared kit primitives, never hand-rolled UI. The five
      the standard names and the kit lacked - `CardGrid`, `MediaShelf`,
      `List`, `DetailPane`, `SplitView` - are now in
      `frontend/src/kit/primitives/`, generic and content-agnostic, with
      the breakpoints and density budgets owned by `kit/responsive.ts`.
      Building them first is what forces the first app into the shared
      vocabulary instead of risking a repeat of legacy's separate
      `VideosRail`/`MusicRail`/`PodcastRail`/`NewsLayout` for what should
      be one shared component. Details in `docs/dev.md`, "The five
      missing kit primitives".
      **Still open, the other half of this item:** a real data-driven nav
      blueprint. `Shell.tsx`'s nav list is still hand-hardcoded, by its
      own comment, pending "the moment a fifth package needs to add an
      entry" - which is whenever the `app` kind work above starts.
- [ ] **Skills as home-screen widgets - cards and rows** (L, needs its own
      design pass before any code - Jesse, 2026-09-05). The idea: a
      skill's data shown on a dashboard as a card (or, for some skills, a
      horizontal row of cards) instead of only being reachable by asking
      for it in chat. Nothing here is decided yet - the card/row system
      itself, which skills opt in, how a manifest declares it - this is
      a real gap, not a small addition.
      **Real prior art from the legacy app**, kept as reference for the
      design pass, not as something to port (the org's "copy from legacy"
      allowance is for hard-won logic, never UI or feature scope - so this
      informs a fresh design, it isn't the design):
      - `homeWidgets.ts` was a single source-of-truth catalog (id, title,
        description, icon, an `allowWide` flag for a full-width 2-column
        tile, and a `toolId` gating availability on whether the backing
        tool/skill was actually installed - the direct precedent for "a
        widget only exists if a real skill backs it," never a "coming
        soon" tile).
      - A `supportsRowMode` flag: some widgets, expanded to full width,
        switched from a vertical card to a horizontal strip of smaller
        cards - the actual "cards vs. rows" distinction Jesse's asking
        about, already had a real precedent.
      - `CardSizeControl.tsx` - a popover slider (range 180-560px, step
        10, default 260) driving one CSS variable
        (`--takeover-card-min`) that every grid consumed via `repeat(
        auto-fill, minmax(var(--takeover-card-min), 1fr))`, persisted per
        app per device. Its own comment names the inspiration directly:
        the Apple Photos / Plex / Lightroom toolbar-zoom pattern. This is
        the "slider to dynamically adjust card size" Jesse referenced -
        real, working code in the legacy app, a good reference point for
        a fresh implementation, not a drop-in port.
      **What a real design pass needs to decide, not guessed at here**:
      whether a manifest's existing `contributes`/`pages` field is the
      right hook for "this package offers a widget," how a lookup skill's
      recipe output (today just `reply.text`/`speech`) maps to structured
      widget data, whether cards refresh live or only on demand, and how
      this interacts with the proactive/caching idea noted below (a
      widget is the most natural place a proactively-fetched fact would
      actually surface).

## Proactive / ambient intelligence

- [ ] **Cache skill lookups proactively, and surface them unprompted when
      relevant** (L, needs its own design pass - Jesse, 2026-09-05).
      The example: a person who knows you like video games might say "oh,
      Grand Theft Auto VI comes out today" without being asked - MaiPai
      doesn't do anything like this today; every skill only ever runs
      when a person's own message routes to it. Three genuinely separate
      pieces, worth naming separately since they're different sizes:
    - **A caching/freshness layer for skill results** (S-M) - the
      scheduler (`host.schedule`/`runDueJobs`) already exists and is real;
      this is "run certain lookups on a schedule and keep the last result
      somewhere," which is mostly new plumbing on top of infrastructure
      that's already built, not a new subsystem.
    - **Matching a cached fact to what a specific person actually cares
      about** (M-L) - needs a real answer to "how does the hub know
      someone likes video games" at all. `memory.ts`'s existing recall
      already does keyword-overlap matching against stored facts, which
      is a plausible starting point (a remembered "I love video games"
      fact matching a cached "GTA VI released" fact), but a dedicated
      interest/preference model would work better and doesn't exist -
      real design work, not just wiring.
    - **Deciding when and how to actually say it** (L) - the hardest and
      most product-sensitive part. Surfacing something unprompted in the
      middle of a conversation risks landing as useful or as intrusive
      depending entirely on timing and judgment a fixed `format` template
      cannot express (the same "no conditional branching in a recipe"
      limit the tier 2 compose-step note above already names). This
      overlaps real estate with the notification system below (both are
      "tell someone something they didn't ask for") but is a distinct
      surface - a notification is its own explicit channel; this is
      about weaving a fact naturally into an ongoing chat, which is
      closer to the persona work's "engagement depth" dimension
      (`docs/dev.md`, companion personas note) than to notifications.
      Worth deciding together with that note rather than separately.

## Voice / robot

- [ ] Wake word past phase 1 (L) - mic capture + inference exists
      in-browser; everything else (barge-in in this repo, satellite mode,
      robot-side wiring) isn't built here.
- [ ] Robot pairing / the link API (L) - not implemented in `home` at all.

## Cross-cutting

- [ ] Cut a first real release (S, but blocking) - no tag has ever been
      made. The deploy-from-release-tag model, the clean-clone build
      check, and update delivery have never been exercised for real.
- [ ] Real i18n (L) - "language and region" is a stored preference today
      with no translation behind it.
- [ ] The notification system (4.13) (L) - not built; several manifests
      already declare a `notifications` field that goes nowhere.

## The other three products (status, not this repo's job to fix)

- **`bot`** (robot companion) - only docs ported from the legacy
  pre-rebuild code onto the fresh repo; the hardware-bench work referenced
  elsewhere was on the *old* codebase, not this platform.
- **`catalog`** (public package store) - repo scaffolding only
  (LICENSE/NOTICE/README, standards pin).
- **`go`** (Apple TV/iPhone client) - marketing copy only, no real app yet.

## How to use this file

- Check an item off only when it's shipped and verified (per
  `getmaipai/.github`'s own definition of done), not when it's started.
- A new gap found while working on something else gets added here, not
  just mentioned in passing in `docs/dev.md`.
- Size tags are a rough gut check for planning, not a commitment.
