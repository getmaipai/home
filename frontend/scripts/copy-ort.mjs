// Copies the onnxruntime-web WASM runtime into public/ort so the
// wake-word engine (2026-09-04, phase 1 of the wake-word plan in
// docs/dev.md) can load it offline, served at /ort/* - the hub's own
// "nothing leaves your house" promise applies to loading the engine
// itself, not just to what it detects, so this is never a CDN fetch.
// Ported from home-legacy.git's own frontend/scripts/copy-ort.mjs. These
// files come from the onnxruntime-web npm package and are regenerable,
// so they're gitignored rather than committed (~38 MB) - this script
// runs automatically before dev/build.
